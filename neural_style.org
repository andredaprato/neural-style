* questions
- Functional with tuple arguments, what do we do about this in general?
- Image preprocessing?
- I'd be happy to, but I think I need to shift my focus a little. The neural
  style example is giving me some pain, since I need to transfer weights from a
  pretrained pytorch model and preprocessing was more annoying than I thought
  it'd be.
